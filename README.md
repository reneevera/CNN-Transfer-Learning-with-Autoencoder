Deep Learning on Fashion MNIST: CNN Transfer Learning with Autoencoder

This notebook begins by setting up the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. The notebook installs TensorFlow and loads the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets. The training images are stored in the "unsupervised_renee" dictionary for autoencoder-based feature learning, while the testing images and labels are stored in "supervised_renee" for supervised tasks. This setup lays the groundwork for experiments involving transfer learning on a CNN, where a pre-trained CNN enhanced by an autoencoder helps extract robust features for improved classification performance.
